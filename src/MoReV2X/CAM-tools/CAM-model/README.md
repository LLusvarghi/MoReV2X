The models are represented by a set of matrices that represent the conditional probabilities of the *m*th order Markov source models proposed. This set of matrices is in the folder called "M_matrix". In total, there are 48 models for:

- Renault and Volkswagen traces.
- Highway, suburban, urban and universal scenarios.
- Complete model, separate CAM time-intervals model and separate CAM sizes model.
- *m*=1 and *m*=5.

In addition, the folder called "PDF" includes the PDF (Probability Density Function) extracted from real traces, necessary to generate the first CAM of a trace when using the models. For the complete models, the joint size and time-interval PDF is provided, while only the CAM time-interval PDF and the CAM size PDFs are provided for the separate time-intervals models and separate sizes models respectively.

The Matlab script "traces_generation_example.m" provides an example of how to generate an arbitrary number of CAM time-intervals and sizes using each of the models.
